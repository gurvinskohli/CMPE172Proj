## Project Introduction
SpartanFoods will be an application that will contain surveys pertaining to food recipes. SpartanFoods will be competent to filter recipes based on dietary restrictions the user has. The user will submit a survey which asks for the dish name, ingredients, etc. There will be a search feature that will assist the user in discovering new recipes that fits the userâ€™s dietary restrictions. As default, there will be a certain number of recipes present on the recipe discovery page but as the application is utilized by users, the number of recipes will increase. The survey will have a direct link to the recipe discovery page. As more users fill out the survey the number of recipes in the recipe discovery page will increase. This application solves the issue individuals with dietary restrictions encounter on a daily basis, which is the perplexing nature of finding recipes that meet their dietary restrictions.
